# React Router v6 Nested Route Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6.  Under specific nesting configurations, child routes fail to render, even when the parent route renders correctly.  This is inconsistent and difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The problem is not with the routes themselves, but with how they interact with other components or routing configurations.  The issue is hard to reproduce reliably, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Solution

The solution presented involves restructuring the routes and potentially refactoring components to ensure consistent rendering.  The corrected example provides a working alternative that avoids the rendering issue.  It may involve simplifying route configurations or enhancing component communication.
